# csvtrans

`csvtrans` is a small utility library for transforming CSV files. The library essentially removes the boilerplate needed to iterate through a CSV, so all that is needed is to specify the source, destination and a function which transforms individual rows.

See [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/ifross89/csvtrans) for documentation.
